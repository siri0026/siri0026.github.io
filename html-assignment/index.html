        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nancy and as you probably already know, I am a current student of the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. This is my first time attending post-secondary studies, and I chose this program because I am a creative who also likes technology. My dream in life is to work remotely while travelling the world and creating art, and I think the lessons from this program will allow me to make that come true.</p>
        <p>I am 21 years old, born on April 23<sup>rd</sup>. One of my favourite movies is <em>Perfect Blue</em> by Satoshi Kon, who is also one of my favourite directors. I enjoy travelling, volunteering, going to concerts and festivals, watching niche films, playing video games and cooking. I also have a passion for learning and am currently diving into psychology and philosophy.</p>
