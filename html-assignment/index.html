        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Nancy and as you probably already know, I am a current student of the IMD program at Algonquin College. This is my first time attending post-secondary studies, and I chose this program because I am a creative who also likes technology. My dream in life is to work remotely while travelling the world and creating art, and I think the lessons from this program will allow me to make that come true.</p>
